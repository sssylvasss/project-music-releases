# Music Releases

The assignment was to create a Spotify inspired page with the use of a json file instead of an API.
We did three sections: singles, albums and a playlist.

We filtered the json to create an array of information for each section and then iterated to display the information required.

## The problem

To start with our main problem was how to approach iteration in React. We were unsure of where it should be (in the App.js or in the component).
To solve this we rewatched the video on props and looked at how other people had approached the problem and then the pieces fell into place.

At times we also had some struggles with the styling but that also fell into place with patience, trial-and-error and at times googling.

We managed to do everything we wanted to add to the project, so there not really anything more we would have added.
